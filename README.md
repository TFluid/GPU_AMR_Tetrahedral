# GPU_AMR_Tetrahedral
A simple example of GPU-accelerated AMR for Tetrahedral

This code serves solely as a minimal working example demonstrating the core principles of the proposed AMR algorithm in the paper. 
Researchers should extend this implementation to develop generalized solutions for production environments.

Please download Visual Stuido 2019 to run this code.
